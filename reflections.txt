## New Skills that I learned:
* The `<strike>` and `<sup>` html tags.  Previously I had done this with CSS.
* I learned about `<strong>` being similar to `<b>` and `<em>` being similar to `<i>`, but that they are better for the accessibility because screen readers treat them differently.

## What has been easy?
