## New Skills that I learned:
* The `<strike>` and `<sup>` html tags.  Previously I had done this with CSS.
** Just learned from a code review that `strike` has been deprecated in HTML5 and so we should instead use `del` or `s` for strikethrough.
* I learned about `<strong>` being similar to `<b>` and `<em>` being similar to `<i>`, but that they are better for the accessibility because screen readers treat them differently.

## What has been easy?
* The layout of the html was really straight forward and something that I am very comfortable with.  I've been doing that for quite some time.

## What has been difficult?
* It's always difficult to get something to look exactly like an image or a pdf.  In my professional experience, the designer gives annotations that state what the font size is, whether it's an h1 or h2, etc.  They don't just leave you hanging without any information about the specifics that they want you to do.

## How have you used the problem solving strategies from the first project to overcome challenges so far?
* Google, lots of Googling.  This lead me to my favorite dev site: stackoverflow.  I love stackoverflow.
